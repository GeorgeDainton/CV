## George Dainton

An enthusiastic, pragmatic, and creative software engineer with a keen eye for detail and a boundless desire to learn. Graduate of Makers Academy April 2022 cohort, where I learnt to code in Ruby, JavaScript and Python in 12 weeks. I was drawn to the tech industry after working in a series of diverse positions through my twenties, trying to find what stimulated me. Seeking equal parts creativity and logical problem solving, I found these in abundance in coding and software development. I am currently learning React in furtherance of my studies at Makers.

## Work Experience

**Production and Set Design Assistant** (October 2016 - present)  
_Freelance_

- Exhibit constant flexibility and pragmatism in response to the ever changing requirements of shoots and productions.
- Requires strict attention to detail - backdrops and flooring must be constructed to the highest standard and props must be sourced with care, so as not to negatively affect the final product.
- Resourcefully acquire props and equipment at short notice and under strict time constraints, sometimes diligently transporting them significant distances.
- I have honed a strong work ethic, often working long hours and maintaining a willing and enthusiastic attitude.


**Service Support Worker** (December 2020 - June 2021)  
_British Red Cross_

As part of a small team I made up part of the British Red Cross' winter COVID initiative, responsible for assisting hospital discharge of some of London's most vulnerable and isolated.
- I learned to be highly resilient to traumatic situations, making reports concerning the liveability of homes and deciding whether council assistance was needed to improve the situation.
- Highly adaptable in response to volatile service users and difficult bureaucratic obstacles, having to frequently alter assistance plans to deliver our service as best as possible.

**Facilities Co-ordinator** (October 2017 - January 2020)
_London Review of Books_

- Used effective time management to meet project deadlines whilst solving problems raised by colleagues on an ad-hoc basis.
- Maintained excellent standards of organisation updating and maintaining a vast asset database covering the entire company site, and utilised a keen eye for detail.
- Employed clear and constant communication skills, written and verbal, to keep all departments abreast of developments during works and refurbishments so work could continue unabated, and navigate difficult interdepartmental disagreements arising from frequent circumstantial changes.

## Skills

#### Keen eye for detail

- At Makers and post graduation one of my strongest coding skills is in debugging. I love to investigate stack traces for clues as to what might be wrong with the code, and I pride myself on being able to spot small syntactic errors.
- Whiislt working at _The London Review of Books_ I oversaw a sizeable asset database, recording every item in the office from servers and air conditioning units to cables and stationery. This required paying close attention to warranty information and serial numbers, and had to be recorded and presented in a detiled yet user friendly way for other consulting the database.
- As a set design assistant I construct backdrops and flooring for high budget fashion editiorials. These have to be flawless and smooth to prevent any adverse effects on film.

#### Clear communicator

- At The London Review of Books, my team and I were at the centre of a substantial 3 floor refurbishment.
- This involved every department in the company, and I was required to liaise with all of them simultaneously to ensure the delivery of the refurbishment as smoothly as possible.
- Entire offices had to be consolidated, along with all their IT and telephone equipment, onto one floor which presented difficult logistical issues.
- Navigated complex interdepartmental and interpersonal conflicts diplomatically and helped parties to reach compromises. 

#### Effective planner with excellent time management

- I helped deliver the best service in a timely fashion to our clients whilst working at the British Red Cross.
- I had to manage my time very effectively, and often cover lots of ground for multiple service users during the day. This meant planning our response thoroughly but also keeping as flexible as possible to account for changes of circumstances in what could often be highly volatile situations.
- I used this skill repeatedly whilst at Makers, as thorough planning is essential to the success of any project, however, working under time constraints and accounting for things such as illness and unforeseen technical issues meant that on group projects plans had to be changed on the fly. This was made much easier by using an agile process, adapting our strategy as and when required.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 to July 2022)

An intensive 12 week full time course with 4 week pre-course, where I learnt:
- Object-Oriented Programming (in Ruby, JavaScript and Python).
- Test Driven Development - the foundation of our process at Makers was TDD, which helped me develop my skills in a highly methodical way accounting for bugs and errors to ensure a stable codebase with minimal technical debt.
- SOLID principles, DRY - high quality code was taught and encouraged at the bootcamp, aided by focusing on keeping our code DRY and as adherent to SOLID principles as possible
- MVC/MTV design - we structured our full stack group projects using MVC/MTV, which made for powerful and effective web applications and were very useful tools to learn about the interrelation of various aspects of software architecture.
- Agile principles and sprint planning, team charters, stand-ups, retros, pair programming
- Web frameworks (Sinatra, Express, Django)
- Git/GitHub version control and collaborative development

#### University of Leeds (September 2013 -  to July 2016)

- BA History
- Upper Second Class Honours (2:1)
- Final dissertation was a comparative analysis of the Italo-German intervention in the Spanish Civil War

## Hobbies

Outside of coding, I'm really into films, history and music, and I enjoy playing football, going climbing and running and a well curated pub quiz.
