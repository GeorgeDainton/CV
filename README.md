## George Dainton

An enthusiastic, pragmatic, and creative software engineer with a keen eye for detail and a boundless desire to learn. Graduate of Makers Academy April 2022 cohort, where I learnt to code in Ruby, JavaScript and Python in 12 weeks. I was drawn to the tech industry after working in a series of diverse positions through my twenties, trying to find what stimulated me. Seeking equal parts creativity and logical problem solving, I found these in abundance in coding and software development. I am currently learning React in furtherance of my studies at Makers![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100138662/183714977-f96fbbad-8d18-4363-b687-01965a9e53ea.png)

## Work Experience

**Production and Set Design Assistant** (October 2016 - present)  
_Freelance_

- Sourcing props for fashion shoots and editorials and assembling sets on location and in various photography studios around London.
- Requires strict attention to detail - backdrops and flooring must be constructed to the highest standard and props must be sourced with care, so as not to negatively affect the final product.
- Liaising with multiple organs of fashion production - photographers, wardrobe, producers, directors etc. in order to play my part in the smooth running of projects running on a strict time schedule.
- Flexibility required at all times. The needs of a shoot can turn on a dime and time constraints often require quick thinking to overcome problems as they arise.

**Service Support Worker** (December 2020 - June 2021)  
_British Red Cross_

- As part of a small team I made up part of the British Red Cross' winter COVID initiative, responsible for assisting hospital discharge of some of London's most vulnerable and isolated.
- I undertook hospital and home visits to ensure that a service user's property was fit for them to be discharged into. This meant ensuring proper heating, electricity and cleanliness. If my team and I deemed the property to be hazardous, we would defer to various council services and charities to help us remedy any issues.
- Required a high degree of resilience. Working conditions could be difficult and upsetting, but our emphasis on placing our service user's needs first meant I learnt to steel myself against traumatic situations and focus on delivering a vital service to those that needed it.

**Delivery Driver** (June 2020 - December 2020)
_DHL_

- During lockdown I worked delivering parcels across the south west of England
- This role was highly autonomous, and involved long working hours. I had to solve any issues that arose myself, and stay focused as I covered long distances often into the evening.

**Facilities Co-ordinator** (October 2017 - January 2020)
_London Review of Books_
Facilities Co-ordinator, London Review of Books: October 2017 – January 2020
•	Used effective time management to meet project deadlines whilst solving problems raised by colleagues on an ad-hoc basis.
•	Maintained excellent standards of organisation updating and maintaining a vast asset database covering the entire company site, and utilised a keen eye for detail.
•	Employed clear and constant communication skills, written and verbal, to keep all departments abreast of developments during works and refurbishments so work could continue unabated, and navigate difficult interdepartmental disagreements arising from frequent circumstantial changes.

## Skills

#### Keen eye for detail



#### Clear communicator

- At The London Review of Books, my team and I were at the centre of a substantial 3 floor refurbishment.
- This involved every department in the company, and I was required to liaise with all of them simultaneously to ensure the delivery of the refurbishment as smoothly as possible.
- Entire offices had to be consolidated, along with all their IT and telephone equipment, onto one floor which presented difficult logistical issues.
- Navigated complex interdepartmental and interpersonal conflicts diplomatically and helped parties to reach compromises. 

#### Effective planner with excellent time management

- I helped deliver the best service in a timely fashion to our clients whilst working at the British Red Cross.
- I had to manage my time very effectively, and often cover lots of ground for multiple service users during the day. This meant planning our response thoroughly but also keeping as flexible as possible to account for changes of circumstances in what could often be highly volatile situations.
- I used this skill repeatedly whilst at Makers, as thorough planning is essential to the success of any project, however, working under time constraints and accounting for things such as illness and unforeseen technical issues meant that on group projects plans had to be changed on the fly. This was made much easier by using an agile process, adapting our strategy as and when required.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 to July 2022)

An intensive 12 week full time course with 4 week pre-course, where I learnt:
- Object-Oriented Programming (in Ruby, JavaScript and Python).
- Test Driven Development - the foundation of our process at Makers was TDD, which helped me develop my skills in a highly methodical way accounting for bugs and errors to ensure a stable codebase with minimal technical debt.
- SOLID principles, DRY - high quality code was taught and encouraged at the bootcamp, aided by focusing on keeping our code DRY and as adherent to SOLID principles as possible
- MVC/MTV design - we structured our full stack group projects using MVC/MTV, which made for powerful and effective web applications and were very useful tools to learn about the interrelation of various aspects of software architecture.
- Agile principles and sprint planning, team charters, stand-ups, retros, pair programming
- Web frameworks (Sinatra, Express, Django)
- Git/GitHub version control and collaborative development

#### University of Leeds (September 2013 -  to July 2016)

- BA History
- Upper Second Class Honours (2:1)
- Final dissertation was a comparative analysis of the Italo-German intervention in the Spanish Civil War

## Hobbies

Outside of coding, I'm really into films, history and music, and I enjoy playing football, going climbing and running and a well curated pub quiz.
